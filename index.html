            <p>As part of my master's program at Appalachian State University, I have been exploring the accessibility movement in education.  This white paper proposes using elements of Universal Design for Learning along with elements from my business background, Agile Development Practices,
            to create learning environments that are accessible to all learners, and encourage self sufficiency, and learner agency.  </p>

            <div class="column-right"><h2>Teaching</h2> <h3>From ESL to HTML</h3> I have been fortunate to be raised in a family that has always valued education.  The son of a surgeon and teacher specializing in reading disabilities, I skipped off of academic work several times before pursuing education full time.  From teaching English as a Second Language to Chinese children, to teaching 7th grade science, to designing tools to teach Air Force officers to attack hardended targets, the transfer of knowledge has always been important in my life.  </p><p>Currently, I am pursuing a Masters in Online Education and Professional Development at Appalachian State University.  My background in software system design and system analysis are being refined in the realm of Learning Engineering.  It is my goal to one day be part of the solution that bridges much of the digital divide between the first and third world, and help develop Education as an Export.</p>

          <p>Even though it's still under construction, check out the teaching unit I'm building in an exercise on Instructional Design.  The learning objective is simple, teach the basics of calories and nutrition.  The difficulty is extreme: Each of us has been living our lives and we tend to think we've been pretty good at it.  Even so, many of us aren't reaching the goals we want.</p>
          <p>This teaching unit will use a variety of media, exercises, and learning methods to encourage a holistic and sustainable approach to healthy goal setting</p>
