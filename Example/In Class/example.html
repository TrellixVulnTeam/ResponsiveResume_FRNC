        <p>I am truly amazed by the part Ryan played in our wedding. He went above and beyond our expectations every step of the way. From staging playful, laid-back engagement pictures to capturing some absolutely stunning moments and formal pictures at our wedding, Ryanâ€™s photography skills matched perfectly with our silly and fun-loving personalities.

      <header>Wedding Photography For Modern Couples</header>
      <p>Many weddings ago, my wife Christine encouraged me to take my passion for photography and follow my dreams of pursuing wedding photography.&nbsp; She and I have both always loved weddings and she encouraged me to take the step into really turning my obsession with photography technique and our mutual love of hospitality and all things love related into a full time job.&nbsp; Since then, we've worked on turning our candid style of documentary photography into beautiful art photography and wedding day portraits.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span>We love love, and celebrate love in all it's forms, regardless of race, religion, or orientation.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p>I've been a baby guy since I was volunteering with my mother in the church nursery, and I've been blessed with three adorable little nephews.&nbsp; Christine and I only have four legged babies right now, so we make up for it by getting to play with everyone else's newborns!&nbsp; We're&nbsp; excellent with kids of all ages, and can </span><a href="http://www.misterguyphotography.com/Portfolio/Children" target="_self">capture your little devils looking their most angelic.</a><br></p>
