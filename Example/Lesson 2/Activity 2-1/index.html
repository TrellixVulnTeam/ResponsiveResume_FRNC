  <h1>Example 02-01</h1>
   <p>The Doctor: The Borg: party-poopers of the galaxy.</p>
 <p>Captain Janeway: There are three things to remember about being a starship captain: Keep your shirt tucked in, go down with the ship, and never abandon a member of your crew.</p>
 <p>[Dr. Zimmerman talking to his EMH]  Dr. Zimmerman: Reginald was right about you. You have exceeded the sum of your program. You've accomplished far more than I could have ever predicted. But let's face facts, you never overcame the inherent flaws in your personality subroutine. You're arrogant. Irritable. A JERK, as Counsellor Troi would say.  The Doctor: I believe she was describing you as well.  Dr. Zimmerman: Don't change the subject.</p>
 <p>Tom Paris: OK, everybody! Place your bets!  [holds out black top hat]  Seamus Driscol: Three bob on Liam!  [puts money in top hat]  Tom Paris: Three bob it is.  The Doctor: Five shillings on Liam.  [puts money in top hat]  Tom Paris: Awww, you'll hurt Harry's feelings.  The Doctor: Oh, very well.  [takes money from top hat]  The Doctor: Two shillings on Mr Kim and I'll pray for a miracle.</p>
 <p>Tom Paris: But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field, there's no real matter involved.  [the holographic doctor slaps Tom]</p>
